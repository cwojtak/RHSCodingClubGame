# RHSCodingClubGame
A game that the RHS Coding Club will be developing.
HOW TO CONTRIBUTE:
If you are pushing a minor bug update, just push it to the main branch with the naming format "main-x.x.x", but if you are creating something completely new or doing major overhauls, please create a new branch with the first version number, and use the naming format first name + "-" + last version of the main branch before this was branched(x.x.x) + "-" + branch version(x). When the modifications are complete, submit a pull request to merge your branch with the main branch.
i.e.
main-0.0.0
connor-1.0.0-999
